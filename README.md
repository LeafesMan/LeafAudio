### Motivation
- Reusable Audio Assets
- Convenient Clip, Pitch, and Volume Variation
- Test Audio outside of play mode
- New Audio Sources needed to support:
  - Playing with different pitches
  - Playing audio that persists through object destruction
- Audio Pooling to reduce strain of creating so many new sources
