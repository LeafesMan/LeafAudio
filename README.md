### Motivation
- Better one shot audio support
  - Reusable Audio Specs
  - Convenient Clip, Pitch, and Volume Variation
    - Play with randomized pitches (Unity's PlayOneShot does not support this)
  - Test Audio outside of play mode
  - Audio sources live after object destruction
    - Audio Source Pooling
